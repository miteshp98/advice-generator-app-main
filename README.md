## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Implemented API fetching using fetch() and Promises to retrieve and display data dynamically.

Gained experience in handling asynchronous operations with Promises to ensure smooth data flow.

Used JavaScript to dynamically update the DOM, enhancing the user experience.

Experimented with CSS animations by toggling classes for a more interactive interface.

```js
const fetchData = () => {
  return fetch(url)
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then((data) => {
      advice.innerHTML = `<q>${data.slip.advice}</q>`;
      id.innerHTML = `ADVICE #${data.slip.id}`;
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      advice.innerHTML = `<p>Error Fetching advice. Please try again later.</p>`;
    });
};
```

### Continued development

I’m eager to dive deeper into API fetching, Promises, and async functions to build more complex and efficient applications.

My next goal is to optimize and explore advanced concepts in asynchronous JavaScript to elevate my development skills.
